## Scaffolded with Vite
### React with PropTypes (full on TS seemed overkill at first)

I'd love to say this is a clean project, with tons of utility and efficient code, and it may be - by some standards.
I became sick with Covid the first day I started playing with this, and ultimately I removed a mass amount of features because trying to 
implement OAUTH with half my brain AND style the web application just wasn't going to happen. 

But it's here. Search for usernames to your hearts delight, until Github's servers deny the request because you've sent too many in too short a time period and it looks sus. 

Once I'm better ( 7 days in, still no improvement) I will return to this and give it the love and attention it deserves.
